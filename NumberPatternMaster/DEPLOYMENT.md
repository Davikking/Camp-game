# Static Deployment Guide

Your educational game is now ready for static deployment! I've solved the Vercel serverless function issues by creating a static version.

## ✅ Problem Solved

I've created a **static version** of your game that:
- Works without server/API calls
- Stores game progress in browser localStorage
- Includes all three levels with full functionality
- Deploys easily on any static hosting platform

## Easy Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your project folder
3. It will auto-detect settings or set:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`

### Option 2: Vercel (Now Works!)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set output directory: `dist/public`

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Set up GitHub Actions for deployment

## What's Changed

✅ **Static storage** - Game sessions saved in browser localStorage
✅ **No server needed** - All logic runs client-side
✅ **Full functionality** - All three levels work identically
✅ **Production ready** - Automatically uses static version when built

Your game includes:
- Level 1: Number pattern recognition
- Level 2: Logic grid puzzle with correct validation
- Level 3: Outlier detection with uniform blue points

Just build and deploy - no configuration needed!

## Your Game Features

- **Level 1**: Number pattern recognition with easy/medium/hard questions
- **Level 2**: Logic grid puzzle (Triangle=Purple/4, Circle=Green/7, etc.)
- **Level 3**: Outlier detection with uniform blue data points
- **Progress tracking** and session management
- **Responsive design** with clean UI

## After Deployment

Your game will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

The deployment is completely free and includes:
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN
- Serverless backend
- No configuration needed

Just push to GitHub and import into Vercel - it's that simple!
