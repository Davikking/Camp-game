# Static Deployment Guide

Your educational game is now ready for static deployment! I've solved the Vercel serverless function issues by creating a static version.

## ✅ Problem Solved

I've created a **static version** of your game that:
- Works without server/API calls
- Stores game progress in browser localStorage
- Includes all three levels with full functionality
- Deploys easily on any static hosting platform

## Easy Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your project folder
3. It will auto-detect settings or set:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`

### Option 2: Vercel (Now Works!)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set output directory: `dist/public`

### Option 3: GitHub Pages (Detailed Steps)
1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Actions workflow**:
   - In your repository, create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Copy the workflow configuration (see below)

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Your game will be available at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME`

## What's Changed

✅ **Static storage** - Game sessions saved in browser localStorage
✅ **No server needed** - All logic runs client-side
✅ **Full functionality** - All three levels work identically
✅ **Production ready** - Automatically uses static version when built

Your game includes:
- Level 1: Number pattern recognition
- Level 2: Logic grid puzzle with correct validation
- Level 3: Outlier detection with uniform blue points

## GitHub Pages Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
2. **Upload your project files** (or use git commands above)
3. **Make sure these files are included**:
   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (already created for you)
   - All your game files
   - `package.json` with build scripts

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### Step 3: Automatic Deployment
1. **Push any changes** to the main branch
2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Build your game (`npm run build`)
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
3. **Check the Actions tab** to see deployment progress
4. **Your game will be live** at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME`

### Step 4: View Your Live Game
- Visit the URL shown in your repository's Pages settings
- Share the link with others to play your game
- Updates automatically deploy when you push changes

**That's it!** Your educational game is now live on the internet for free.

## Troubleshooting GitHub Pages

### If you see "Process completed with exit code 254" or other errors
This happens when the build process fails. I've created a simplified deployment workflow:

**Solution: Use the simple deployment file**
1. In your repository, use `.github/workflows/simple-deploy.yml` instead
2. Delete or rename the original `deploy.yml` file
3. This simplified version:
   - Uses `npm install` (no lock file issues)
   - Builds only the frontend with `npx vite build`
   - Combines build and deploy in one job

**Alternative: Manual deployment**
1. Run `npx vite build` locally
2. Upload the `dist/public` folder contents to GitHub Pages manually
3. Or use GitHub's web interface to upload files

### If you see a white screen after deployment
This happens when the base path isn't configured correctly. I've fixed this:

**Automatic fix applied:**
- Updated workflow to build with `--base=/Camp-game/` (matches your repository name)
- Added debugging output to check build results
- This ensures assets load correctly on GitHub Pages

**To verify the fix:**
1. Push the updated `.github/workflows/simple-deploy.yml` file
2. Check the Actions tab - you'll see build debug output
3. Your game should now display correctly

### If deployment still fails
1. Check the **Actions** tab for detailed error logs
2. Make sure your repository is **public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
3. Verify your repository name matches the base path in the workflow
4. Try the manual deployment approach above

## Your Game Features

- **Level 1**: Number pattern recognition with easy/medium/hard questions
- **Level 2**: Logic grid puzzle (Triangle=Purple/4, Circle=Green/7, etc.)
- **Level 3**: Outlier detection with uniform blue data points
- **Progress tracking** and session management
- **Responsive design** with clean UI

## After Deployment

Your game will be available at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

The deployment is completely free and includes:
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN
- Serverless backend
- No configuration needed

Just push to GitHub and import into Vercel - it's that simple!
